# Summary

 * We can *measure* a good part of the metabolomics and proteomes
 * Study *differences* in abundance (ill/normal, young/old, etc)
 * *characterization != identity*
 * With identification we can do *pathway analysis*
 * But without we can already do tons of useful *statistical analysis*!
